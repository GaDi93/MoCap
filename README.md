# MoCap

MoCap is an Open Source project without any financial motivation. The main goals are defined as follows:
  • to measure and capture the motion of cyclists 
	• to calculate the strengths impacting the body during movement
  • for injury prevention during the training by bike

Technical constraints:
	• low budget for the hardware used
  • limited accurancy due to the hardware available
